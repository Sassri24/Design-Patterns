# 🛠️ Design Patterns  

Welcome to the **Design Patterns** repository! 🚀 This project showcases the implementation of three essential design patterns: **Adapter**, **Observer**, and **Singleton**. Each pattern is demonstrated with clear examples to illustrate its purpose and practical use. 💡  

---

## 📖 What's Inside?  

1. **Adapter Pattern** 🧩  
   - Converts an interface of a class into another interface clients expect.  

2. **Observer Pattern** 👀  
   - Establishes a one-to-many dependency, notifying all dependents of state changes.  

3. **Singleton Pattern** 🔒  
   - Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it.

## 🛠️ How to Use  

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/Sassri24/Design-Patterns.git  
   ```  

2. **Explore the Code**:  
   Each pattern is organized into its folder with code and comments explaining its implementation.  

3. **Run the Examples**:  
   Open your preferred IDE, compile, and execute the Java files to see each pattern in action.
